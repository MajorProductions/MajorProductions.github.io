I spent most of my childhood at home trying to get my dad to let me play the MMO he was playing at that time. When I was under five years old I lived in Tucson Arizona. There I played Everquest a lot. Granted, I had not a clue as to what I was doing, but I do remember loving the frog dudes. Of course, all good things must come to an end and we moved to a quiet town called Wilcox in Arizona. The town where my father was from.</strong></p><p><strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Wilcox was extremely quiet if you stayed out of the drama, which I tried to stay out of. When we first moved there I was about to turn five years old. While living in our first house I spent as much time as I could playing a game my father had gotten beta access to - World of Warcraft. I will cover more about this topic in the Blizzard section, but for now, I will say that I found my first addiction in World of Warcraft. I remember playing so many games when I was a child, other kids must have been jealous.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Well, they would probably be jealous if I had ever left my house long enough to tell them. I tried to avoid school as much as possible because I never got along with other kids as much as I wish I could have. So, to avoid interactions with other kids I stayed inside and played even more games. As I played more and more games I found an absolute love for them. It was at this point I decided that I wanted to learn how people made games and I wanted to go on to make games of my own. Of course, it took me a while, but I guess I am kinda there now...</strong></p></div>

It was around 7th grade when my parents realized that I was getting bullied at my school, so we took up and moved to the nearby city of Sierra Vista. There I had been given a second chance at making a first impression. I tried making friends and I ended up developing a 'friend' personality. I know speak and act differently than how I did in the past and it seems to have worked out for the best because I have a lot of friends nowadays.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; As I got into high school I started to think about how little time I have left to pursue my goal - to learn how to code. I decided that it was time to focus on it as much as I possibly could. I got in touch with a few professional programmers and asked them for some tips on where I could start. A lot of them suggested things like code-less programming apps, but I found these brain-dead and boring. Eventually, I came across a fellow named Chicken Bones while coding Terraria mods.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; It's this figure, Chicken Bones who influenced me to learn C# as my first language. I contacted him when I had destroyed my mod with errors and he was willing to help. After multiple days of contacting him back and forth he eventually asked me why I wanted to code. After sharing my story with him he suggested I try jumping head first into a coding language, so I asked him which one he thought was a good one to start with, and he said C Sharp. So I jumped to Unity and started messing around with creating applications. Three years later and here I am.</strong><br></p></div>

I don't really see or interact with the cats, but that's probably for the best because I'm not really a cat person. In my past, I've had other animals as shown in the slide. There is the chihuahua's daughter named Daisy, but she passed a while back. The same goes for the black lab who was named Pepper. We also had two cats, one named Salem and the other named Stinky. Salem is the black one and Stinky is the other.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; The first of the two pit-bulls is the father who is named Smalls, and his daughter who is named Kaya like the Bob Marley album. They are sweet but defensive. While there is not much more to say, we love and care for all of our animals, we are a pet family.</strong></p></div>
